# Reporting Security Issues

We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings, and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

To report a security issue, please privately use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/vuelessjs/vueless/security/advisories/new) tab. If that is impossible, feel free to send an email to [report@vueless.com](mailto:report@vueless.com) instead.

All security vulnerabilities will be promptly verified and addressed.

We also recommend always using the latest versions of Vueless and other dependencies by maintaining lock files (yarn.lock, package-lock.json and pnpm-lock.yaml) in order to ensure your application remains as secure as possible.

Report security bugs in third-party modules to the person or team maintaining the module. You can also report a vulnerability through the [npm contact form](https://www.npmjs.com/support) by selecting "I'm reporting a security vulnerability".
